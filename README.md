# ELEC70127 - ML-for-Tackling-Climate-Change

This repository focuses on detecting methane plumes from Hyperspectral image bands. 


We built upon the current state of the art model to improve false positive rate while maintaining model sensitivity.

Our architectures include: ResUNet, UNet++ and TransUNet. 

We have used a subset of AVIRIS STARCOP ML ready dataset. 

Our models show significant impact on segementation of Methane plumes and have potential on urban development. 

We have improved our architectures to reduce the false positive rate
